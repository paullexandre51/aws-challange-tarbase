1. EC2
- Create an EC2 (Latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI) t3a.micro on eu-west-1 region.
- Use the default VPC and pick a subnet of your choice.
- Create an pem key to SSH into the instance later on step 3 (this step is done in the console prior to cfn deploy).
- Attache an additional volume with 10Gb.
- Attache an EIP.

2. S3 Bucket
- Create an S3 Bucket s3://tarbase-<aws account id>-yourname

The last step can be done via SSH/awscli or with CloudFormation.

3. Copy file
- Access to your EC2 via SSH
- Compress /var/log/* into a tar or zip file <your-ec2-instance-id>.zip
- Upload that file to your bucket from the instance you created moments ago.


Extra points if:
- You use tags to identify your project.
- You find a way to add the last step (3.) to your CloudFormation template. Check some special declaration here (1).
- Figure a way to encrypt the EC2 volume and S3 bucket also in CloudFormation. You will need to create additional resources.
- Format the extra EBS volume with ext4 filesystem and add it to /etc/fstab. (If you figured how to copy the files from your instance to the bucket with CloudFormation, you will know how to do this also in CloudFormation - otherwise - you can SSH into your instance.
- You create a private github or gitlab repo to register all your iterations.
